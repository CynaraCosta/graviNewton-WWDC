# GraviNewton 🍎

## The project ⌨️

Have you ever stopped to think about how things happened? What if they were different? Are there other factors that directly influenced this? Well then! GraviNewton will show you the world before gravity was discovered! Where you can find out what happened to Newton and the famous story of the apple. What if Earth's gravity was different? What would you have with him?

GraviNewton is an application to help you visualize this, in an educational and dynamic way!

## Development 👩🏻‍💻

In this version of the app, I put my first knowledge of swift into practice, so autolayout is something that needs to be worked on. In addition to additional features that can bring more life to the application in general, such as background music.

## Frameworks 📚

For this project I used SwiftUI 👾 in Swift and AVKit language for sound effects. In addition to using Garageband to create the sounds of the game and the PixelArt website to create most of the design of the App.
